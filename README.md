## üßê Overview <a name = "overview"></a>

This boilerplate aims to provide developers with a quick start for building interactive 3D applications using React and Three.js with Vite. It simplifies the setup process and offers a structured foundation for creating immersive 3D experiences within web applications.

## Features Explored & Used <a name="features"></a>

### Scene Setup

- **Description**: The scene serves as the container for all objects, cameras, and lights in a 3D environment.
- **Functionality**: Manages the placement and rendering of objects, as well as the overall atmosphere and background of the scene.

### Camera

- **Description**: Determines the viewpoint and perspective of the scene.
- **Functionality**: Controls the position, orientation, and projection properties.

### Renderer

- **Description**: Renders the scene using WebGL, allowing it to be displayed on the screen.
- **Functionality**: Transforms 3D objects and scenes into 2D images.

### Geometry

- **Description**: Defines the shape and structure of 3D objects in the scene.
- **Functionality**: Specifies the vertices, edges, and faces of the object.

### Material

- **Description**: Determines the appearance of objects by defining their color, texture, and surface properties.
- **Functionality**: Affects how light interacts with the object.

### Mesh

- **Description**: Represents a 3D object composed of a geometry and a material.
- **Functionality**: Combines the shape and appearance of an object into a single entity.

### Animation Loop

- **Description**: Creates a continuous loop to update and render the scene, resulting in smooth animations.
- **Functionality**: Utilizes requestAnimationFrame to ensure optimal performance.

### @react-three/fiber

- **Description**: A React renderer for Three.js, facilitating the integration of Three.js scenes into React applications.
- **Functionality**: Provides a declarative API for creating and manipulating 3D objects, along with hooks and components for seamless integration.

### @react-three/drei

- **Description**: A collection of useful hooks, components, and utilities for @react-three/fiber, enhancing development productivity.
- **Functionality**: Offers pre-built components for camera controls, lights, and other common elements, as well as utilities for handling textures, materials, and animations more conveniently.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Follow these simple steps to set up your development environment:

1. Navigate to your project directory:

2. Install dependencies using npm: npm install --legacy-peer-deps

That's it! You're all set up and ready to go!

Now, start the development server by running the following command: npm run dev
Begin building your React application with Three.js!
